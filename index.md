# About

Hello! I’m Ron Rochwerg, a PhD student in Computer Science at [Queen’s University](https://www.queensu.ca/), co‑supervised by [Dr. Ting Hu](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/people/Ting/Hu) and [Dr. Christian Muise](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/people/Christian/Muise). 


My current research explores the use of program synthesis to construct rule-based models from human-readable explanations, particularly those written in domain-specific languages. This approach inverts the typical modeling process by generating the explanation first, then synthesizing a model based on it. The overall goal is to leverage domain expertise to produce task-specific models that align with human reasoning and maintain transparency by being interpretable by design.
