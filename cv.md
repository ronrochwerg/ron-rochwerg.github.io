# Course Creation

I contributed to the development of the Queen’s School of Computing TA Training Course, a program designed to support first-time teaching assistants in understanding their roles and responsibilities. The course focused on key areas such as professional communication, accountability, and effective grading and feedback. My contributions included designing instructional content and assessments, including lessons and quizzes, to ensure new TAs were well-prepared to interact with both students and faculty.
